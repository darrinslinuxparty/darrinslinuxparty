- 👋 Hi, I’m @darrinslinuxparty
- 👀 I’m interested in all things Linux, scripting, and automation/configuration management tools like Ansible and Puppet.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Systems Engineering and DevOps skills. Bash and Python are my desired languages, but I've had to learn to use over a dozen other languages in my career to get the job done.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on public projects as I publish them.
- 📫 How to reach me:
